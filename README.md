# Chrome Extension Template with Next.js

## Description

build a chrome extension with next.js

```bash:bash
npm run export
```

## Usage

If you want to use the ChromeAPI, you will need to use dynamic import.

If you get webpack errors during the build, please change the import path in /src/scripts to a relative path.

## TODO

You have to `npm run export` every time you want to check, which is not very efficient for development.
